espruino-font-dennis8
=====================

Espruino module with a custom font containing most latin-derived characters used in languages
like German, Spanish, French, Turkish etc. plus useful symbols.

Dennis8 is a variable-width sans-serif bitmap font with 8 pixels height and at most 6 pixels
character width (most characters are narrower to save space on small displays). It extends
Espruino's 6x8 Sebasic font. The charset is losely based on ISO 8859-1 (Latin1) however
symbols such as arrows, music control, home button etc. were added to facilitate development
of common embedded applications.
